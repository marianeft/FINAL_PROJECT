**ReelSense** is an intelligent web-based application designed to provide automated sentiment analysis and rating insights for movie reviews. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, ReelSense reads and interprets user-generated reviews, converting emotional tone into a clear, 1–5 star rating system. 

It provides a dynamic way to evaluate audience feedback by translating written opinions into a simple 1–5 star system—where positive sentiments shine with higher ratings and negative ones earn fewer stars.This makes it easier than ever to get a quick, meaningful snapshot of audience sentiment. *From opinions to stars—see what shines with ReelSense.*
